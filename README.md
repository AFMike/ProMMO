Multiplayer tools for persistent worlds.

Please use one of the branches.

**4.18 Stock:**  This runs on the stock 4.18.x engine.  It is missing some important OSS functionality, and has hacky workarounds in place to provide the required functionality.  Chat channel list changed, and Friends list chaged delegates are set up to be polling instead.  Matchmaker and Tournaments are non-functional.  You can use this for testing and evaluation, but for serious projects, you should use the enhanced version instead.

**4.18 OSS Enhanced:**  This requires a patched version of the engine, and the OSS enhanced UETopia plugin.  This contains all of the proper functionality implemented correctly.  Use this for serious projects.
